# World_Population_and_Birth_Rates

> This capstone project studies data from United Nation Department of Economic and Social Affairs from 1950-2020. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs serves as the liaison connecting global policies on economic, social, and environmental matters with actions taken at the national level. My focus was on the countries policies aimed to increase the declining birth rates and their policies effectiveness.

## General Information
- Many countries around the world are experiencing worrying declines in birth rates that could have major economic, social and political implications if left unaddressed. In response, governments have implemented various policies like enhanced parental leave, childcare subsidies, baby bonuses and even restrictions on abortion access in an attempt to incentivize higher fertility. 

## Motivation 
- I am motivated to research this topic because of my firsthand experience working with prenatal mothers early in my career. This experience plus the recent policy changes has me wondering about how various factors, especially government interventions, influence birth trends and family planning decisions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for creating effective policies that support families and address demographic challenges.

## Data Questions
- How have birth rates and fertility rates changed in regions or countries following the implementation of specific government policies
-	How has birth rates change over time in the United States and other countries. 
-	How do birth and fertility rates in countries with similar economic and social conditions but different policies compare?
-	What are the factors contributing to low birth rates in the country

1. Download data from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Archive/Standard/
2. I used Python and Excel to clean data
3. Used PowerBI for visualizations 
4. Data can be used to view the changes in birth rate
5. Compare country populations over time
6. Dive into population stats for each country
7. Interactive charts to visualize data


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 

## Room for Improvement

~ While the data set I used was large and a good data source, incorporating data from additional sources such as the World Bank and others could provide a more comprehensive view. 
~ To better understand the long-term effects of policies, a more extensive longitudinal analysis could be conducted. 
~ External factors such as economic downturns, pandemics (COVID-19), and cultural shifts should be considered as they can also influence birth and fertility rates.
